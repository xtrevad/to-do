LOGIC LEVELS


TOP LEVEL
*Project array

*Project constructor 
  => full of individual 'to-do'

*To-do constructor


Brainstorm what kind of properties your todo-items are going to have.
At a minimum they should have a 

      * title 
      * description
      * dueDate 
      * priority

You might also want to include notes or even a checklist.
Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos.
When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’
project to which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to
create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
